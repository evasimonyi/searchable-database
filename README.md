# Searchable database

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This is a frontend app with hardcoded data.\
It was created for practicing.\
The tutorial can be found [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html).\
I used functional componants, and for the sake of simplicity, no state manager,
but rather passing callbacks wherever I needed.\
The result:\
![searchable database](/public/searchable-database.png)\
![filtered items](/public/filtered-items.png)\
![stocked items](/public/stocked-items.png)\

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `yarn start`: Runs the app in the development mode.\
  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
